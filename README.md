# t3-static

The purpose of this template is to provide a base to use the t3 app structure, with the new beta features of next.js version 13 on netlify for static sites. Only t3 options relevant to static front-end sites were chosen.

includes:
- tailwind

excludes:
- prisma
- trpc
- next-auth

Next.js has been updated to version 13. The experimental app directory option is enabled, and the template has been updated to use this directory (located in `/src/app/`).
